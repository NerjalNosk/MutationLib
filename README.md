# MutationLib

Updating Minecraft registries on the fly.

Aims to be a first of its kind library allowing mods to take on 
themselves to load brand-new content at will, without requiring
either the client or the server to start again.

In order to avoid security threats, this shall not allow a server
to make a client load and execute actual code.<br>
It would rather send templates for the client to execute.

**Forth come the MOTH mods!**<br>
*Which would stand for Mods On The Fly, but hey, a moth is still
pretty close to a fly, and it sounds way better*
